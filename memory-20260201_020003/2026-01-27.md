# 2026-01-27 Session Notes

## Jake's Setup
- **Home Assistant**: Connected via MCP (ha-mcp) at 10.0.0.7:8123
- **Proxmox**: Available but no SSH access configured yet
- **GitHub**: jakehase - token shared (should be rotated)

## PMHNP Billing Website - COMPLETED
- **Domain**: pmhnpbilling.com
- **Repo**: github.com/jakehase/pmhnpbilling.com
- **Preview**: jakehase.github.io/pmhnpbilling.com
- **Status**: Site built and live on GitHub Pages

### Design Choices
- Logo: PB monogram (option 6) with styled text
- Text style: "PMH" underlined + gradient, dot separator, "Billing"
- Colors: Blue primary (#2563eb)
- Hero: Healthcare stock photo with light white gradient overlay
- Hamburger menu for mobile
- Sections: Hero, Services (6 cards), About, Trust/Why Choose, Contact form

### Still TODO
1. **DNS setup** - Need to point pmhnpbilling.com to GitHub Pages
2. **Formspree** - Contact form needs backend connected
3. **HIPAA-compliant onboarding portal** - Jake wants self-hosted on Proxmox

## Security Check
- Clawdbot gateway bound to loopback (127.0.0.1) - SECURE
- Not exposed on Shodan like other misconfigured instances
- Jake asked about security after seeing Shodan results

## Next Steps
- Build self-hosted HIPAA-compliant client intake portal on Proxmox
- Need Proxmox access (SSH/credentials) to set this up
