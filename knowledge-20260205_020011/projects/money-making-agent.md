## Time Commitment

**Non-negotiable oversight required:**

- **Weekly (30 min):** Review dashboard, approve decisions, check platforms
- **Monthly (1 hr):** P&L review, strategy adjustments
- **As-needed:** Respond to alerts (disputes, warnings, opportunities)

**Total:** ~2.5 hours/month

**Reality check:** This is a side hustle, not passive income. Requires consistent attention.

|------|---------|-------|
| LLM (Kimi K2.5) | $25 | General tasks |
| Kimi Code | $0 | Coding tasks (free tier) |
| Platform fees | $10 | Upwork/Fiverr connects |

## Risk Analysis

### Failure Modes
1. **Platform bans** (12% risk) - Automation detection
2. **Quality issues** - Client complaints, bad reviews
3. **Cash flow death** - Money tied up, can't scale
4. **Competition** - Margin compression

### Downside Protection
- Service Arbitrage alone hits $5k target
- SaaS is bonus/insurance
- Diversification across 2 strategies
- Human oversight prevents most bans

### Worst Case
- Lose ~$200-300 (not full $400)
- Lessons learned for retry

## Model Strategy (Cost Optimization)

| Task | Model | Cost |
|------|-------|------|
| General chat, advice | Kimi K2.5 | Paid |
| Coding, debugging, configs | **Kimi Code** | **FREE** |
| Technical implementation | **Kimi Code** | **FREE** |

**Savings:** ~$25/month by using Kimi Code for coding tasks

## Prerequisites Before Launch

- [ ] $400 capital committed
- [ ] Upwork/Fiverr accounts (verified)
- [ ] Stripe account for SaaS
- [ ] Weekly 30-min calendar block for oversight
- [ ] Accept 20% success rate mentally

---

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Launch or not?** - 20% hit rate, requires consistent effort
2. **Start with $400 or test with $100?** - Can scale up if working
3. **Single strategy or both?** - Diversification vs focus
4. **Timeline flexibility?** - 6 months is aggressive; 12 months = higher success

## Simulation Files

Detailed models saved:
- `money-agent-simulation.md` - Original $50 vs $1k comparison
- `money-agent-simulation-v2.md` - $1k with oversight (physical work)
- `money-agent-simulation-v3-digital.md` - **$400 fully digital (this one)**
- `oversight-comparison.md` - Why 30 min/week is non-negotiable
- `api-costs-breakdown.md` - Operating cost breakdown
- `model-impact-simulation.md` - Model quality impact on success

---

## Next Steps (If Proceeding)

1. **Decision:** Commit to $400 and 6-month timeline?
2. **Setup:** Configure platforms, tools, monitoring
3. **Launch:** Start with Service Arbitrage (faster cash flow)
4. **Week 1-2:** Lean phase, minimal costs, prove concept
5. **Month 1 review:** Pivot or scale based on data

## Honest Assessment

- 88% chance of profit (not loss)
