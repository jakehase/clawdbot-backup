# MECE Organization Principles

**MECE = Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**

Every file has ONE clear purpose that no other file shares. Every topic has a home.

## Before Creating ANY File

1. Check if a similar file already exists
2. Extend existing files rather than duplicating
3. One topic = one file
4. Update INDEX if adding new files

## Workspace Structure

```
/root/clawd/
├── Root level: Config only (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.)
├── knowledge/     ← PARA knowledge base
│   ├── projects/  ← Active work
│   ├── areas/     ← Ongoing responsibilities  
│   ├── resources/ ← Reference material
│   └── archives/  ← Completed/inactive
├── scripts/       ← Automation scripts
├── memory/        ← Daily logs
└── logs/          ← System logs
```

## Anti-Duplication Rules

- Before creating a script → check if one exists
- Before creating a note → check knowledge base
- Before adding a feature → check if it's already handled
- Two files about the same thing = one file too many
