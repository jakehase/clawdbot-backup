# 2026-01-29 Session Notes

## QMD Skill Installed
- Local markdown search tool for docs/notes
- Installed via npm (bun kept OOM killing)
- Indexed `/root/clawd` as collection "clawd" (18 files, 99 embeddings)
- `qmd search` for keyword, `qmd vsearch` for semantic

## SSH Access to Home Assistant
- Generated SSH key: `~/.ssh/ha_esphome`
- HA IP: `10.0.0.7`, port 22
- ESPHome configs at: `/config/esphome/`
- Can now edit ESPHome YAML directly

## ESP32-S3-Box-3 Modified
- Updated `lights_page` from 6 small bulbs → 2 big bulbs
- Left bulb (yellow): Hallway toggle (`light.hallway_2`)
- Right bulb (cyan): All Lights toggle (hallway + kitchen + `switch.living_room_lamp`)
- Living room lamp is a **switch**, not a light entity
- Backup saved before changes

## Polymarket Weather Experiment
- Jake interested in weather prediction market trading
- Set up paper trading project at `/root/clawd/projects/polymarket-weather/`
- First prediction: Seoul Jan 30 high temp = **-4°C** (2/3 models agree: GFS, JMA)
- Weather models: Open-Meteo API (GFS, ECMWF, JMA) — free, no key needed
- Need to track outcomes and measure if we have edge

## New Skills Installed
- **browser-use**: Cloud browser automation (needs API key from browser-use.com)
- **tavily**: AI-optimized web search (needs API key from tavily.com)
- **google-workspace**: Gmail/Calendar/Drive via OAuth (no Google Cloud Console needed)
- **qmd**: Already working

## Jake's Setup Reminders
- Aqara FP2 presence sensors (indoor lux affected by room lights)
- Sun elevation better than lux for "is it daylight" decisions
- Interested in Proxmox skill (has Proxmox but no API access set up yet)

## Discussed but Declined
- Self-review/MISS-FIX journaling system (too much overhead for marginal gain)
