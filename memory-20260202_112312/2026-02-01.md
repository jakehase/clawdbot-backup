# 2026-02-01 Session Notes

## Major Implementations

### HIPAA Billing Automation
- Built at `/root/clawd/pmnhp-billing/billing-automation/`
- 2,075 lines TypeScript: encryption, audit logging, RBAC auth, claim status checker
- Fixed TypeScript errors, compiles and runs on port 3000
- Default login: admin / admin123 (needs changing)
- Start with: `./start.sh` or `node dist/index.js`
- AES-256 encryption, tamper-proof audit logs, SQLite encrypted DB

### Browserable (Self-Hosted Browser Automation)
- Installed at `/root/clawd/browserable/`
- Services: MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, Tasks (2003), UI (2001)
- Access: `http://10.0.0.220:2001`
- Had to fix: disabled single-user mode, updated API URLs from localhost to 10.0.0.220
- Still needs: LLM provider API key + browser provider API key to fully work

### MCP Integration Enhanced
- Added 3 new MCP servers via mcporter:
  - Filesystem (14 tools, sandboxed to /root/clawd)
  - Notion (22 tools)
  - Chrome DevTools (26 tools)
- Total: 63 tools (was 1)

### HA AI Automation Suggester
- Installed at `/config/custom_components/ai_automation_suggester/` on HA
- Requires UI setup: Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration
- Recommend Groq (free) - get key at console.groq.com

### Voice Assistant Enhancements
- Enabled "Hey Jarvis" wake word (was commented out)
- Added voice commands: "Good morning", "Good night", "What's the weather"
- Config backup created, needs ESPHome compile/upload to activate

### Additional Skills Installed
- git-essentials - Git workflow commands
- timesheet - Time tracking (may need `npm install -g timesheet-cli`)
- weather - Weather queries, no API key needed

## Model Preferences (Updated)
- **Coding sub-agents**: Kimi Code (kimi-code/kimi-for-coding) - FREE
- **Everything else**: Opus 4.5 (anthropic/claude-opus-4-5)
- Noted in MEMORY.md

## Security Audit Results
| Item | Risk | Verdict |
|------|------|---------|
| HA AI Automation | MEDIUM | OK with token rotation |
| Browser Automation | HIGH | Don't use cloud for HIPAA - self-host |
| MCP Integration | MEDIUM | OK with sandboxing |
| Billing Automation | CRITICAL | Needs full HIPAA review before production |
| Voice Assistant | HIGH | Verify local-only processing |
| Agent Skills | MEDIUM | Consider sandboxing |

## Tebra Integration
- Jake asked about Tebra (practice management/EHR)
- Can integrate via browser automation (Playwright in billing system)
- Tebra API is partner-level access (not public)
- Browser automation approach is most flexible

## Kimi Code Issues
- Kimi Code sub-agents failing silently (1-2 second runtime, no output)
- Had to do TypeScript fixes manually instead of via sub-agent
- May be a model/API issue - monitor
