# Knowledge Base (PARA Method)

Personal knowledge management using the PARA method. Gladys can search this with `qmd`.

## Structure

- **projects/** - Active projects with clear goals/deadlines
- **areas/** - Ongoing responsibilities (no end date)
- **resources/** - Reference material, topics of interest
- **archives/** - Completed/inactive items

## Usage

Add markdown files to any folder. Gladys will search them when relevant.

Examples:
- `projects/pmhnp-billing-site.md` - Current project notes
- `areas/smart-home.md` - Ongoing home automation notes
- `resources/billing-codes.md` - Reference material
- `archives/old-project.md` - Completed work

Run `qmd update` after adding files to re-index.
